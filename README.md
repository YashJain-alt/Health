We created a gamified fitness website that includes gameplay with excercise. The layout includes sections for user stats, challenges, and a shop. Users can track their level, XP, and coins, making the experience engaging.

On our home page we have sections for Rewards, Shop, Leaderboard, Profile and About us with a start Today's challenge section below.

The daily challenges offer randomized tasks each day and lets users complete challenges once for rewards. Completing these challenges, grants XP, coins and levels up the user, making it feel rewarding to progress.

In the shop, users can spend their coins on various incentives such as vouchers, memberships, and it shows back the total amount in cart. We also focused on making everything visually appealing, with a pleasing colour codes that includes well-styled buttons and an interactive layout. 

The Leaderboard section tells about our standing among our friends and the people we know and it helps to motivate the user to remain at the top

We have also added an about us page to tell you the user about our team to contact us for any grieveances.

Lastly, one of the Main and Most Important Feature of this project is that it is made purely with HTML.
